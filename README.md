## ðŸŒ± Must-have features




### âœ…Step 1: read
- On the overview page, build an overview of everything in the collection (you will find some provided code that's helpful for this)

### âœ…Step 2: create
- Build a form that contains all the relevant fields
- Once the form is submitted, save this info as a new entry in the database
- In a real application, you'd validate all of the data. In this case it's optional: focus on the database parts first

### âœ…Step 3: update
- Make a new page edit.php
- When clicking on an edit link for an entry, the edit page is loaded for that specific item
- When the edit form is submitted, the relevant entry in the database is updated

### âœ…Step 4: delete
- Build a link to delete.php that will delete a specific product from the database
- Afterwards, it will redirect to the overview

## ðŸŒ¼ Nice to have

- Check who might need your help. Maybe your discoveries can already prove valuable to your peers?
- Pair up with someone: what difference do you have in your approach? Discuss and look for opportunities to further improve your code.
- Once an item is clicked, a detail page is loaded (called show.php, no styling needed). What PHP technique can you use to specify the id of that product on the detail page?
- âœ…So everything works for the good guys? Nice! What if the bad guys discover your site too...? Read up on SQL injection and protect your code against it.
- What interesting data can you include for your collection: images or fetch some stuff from an API - found something? Go for it!

## ðŸŒ³ Nice to have (hard)
- âœ…Create a filter for your collection:
    - Update your database: instead of a simple list of items, give every item in your list their own properties. (E.g.: add element type to your Pokemon)
    - Have a filter bar that will display whatever has been selected (if not, it shows the whole list)
- Timestamp changes and use soft deletes instead of permanent deletions:
  - âœ…Add `updated_at` as a new column to your table.
  - âœ…Whenever you update an item on your list, make sure a new timestamp is saved in `updated_at` as well.
  - âœ…Upon deleting an item from your list, instead of removing the item from the database, check how you can apply **soft deletes** in your application.
